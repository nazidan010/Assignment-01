    <h3><b>Why Web Development??</b></h3>
    <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers. <br> While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates, these tend to <br>look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers.</p>

        <h3><b>I will Do Coding and Change The World</b></h3>
        <p>Hey guys. I've been programming for a while now and I've reached the point where I'm tired of learning new tips and techniques, and instead just want to create things, day in and day out. I've been wanting to do this for a while now, and I think I'm ready. I want to create my very own Libraries/Frameworks (and maybe even a Programming Language in the future). What I need right now is ideas. There are honestly so many programming languages, libraries and frameworks out there that it's really hard to think of a good idea. Any suggestions?</p>
